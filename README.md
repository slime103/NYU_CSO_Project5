# NYU_CSO_Project5
A project covering file I/O in C and parent child processes.

Created for Professor Douglas Moody's CSO class at NYU.

The program is meant to display runtime speed difference for I/O with multiple processes running.
Additionally, it is meant to show the benefit of having multiple processes run that can communicate with each other using signals.

Thanks to my TA Samasth Norway Ananda for answering quesiton while I completed this project.
